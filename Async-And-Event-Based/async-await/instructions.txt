1.Write an async function that returns a string after waiting for 2 seconds. Use the setTimeout function to simulate the delay.

2.Implement a series of async functions that perform arithmetic operations: one function adds two numbers, another multiplies the result by 2, and a third subtracts 5. Chain these functions using await.

3.Write an async function that takes multiple Promises and uses Promise.race() to return the result of the first Promise that resolves or rejects.

4.Create three async functions that simulate different tasks (e.g., fetching user data, fetching posts, fetching comments). Ensure they execute in sequence using await.

5.Write an async function that attempts to divide two numbers. If the denominator is zero, throw an error and handle it gracefully using a try/catch block.
