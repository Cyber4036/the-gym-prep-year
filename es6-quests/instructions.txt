Practical Questions (for the below questions use ES6 practices)

1. Write a function `findProperty` that takes an object and a string as arguments. The function should return the value of the property with the given string name if it exists in the object. If the property doesnâ€™t exist, return `"Property not found"`.
    
2. Write a function `mergeObjects` that takes two objects as arguments and returns a new object that combines all properties from both objects. If a property exists in both objects, the value from the second object should overwrite the value from the first.
    
3. Write a function `countKeys` that takes an object as an argument and returns the number of properties (keys) it has.
        
4. Write a function `findLargest` that takes an array of numbers as an argument and returns the largest number in the array.
   
5. Write a function `reverseString` that takes a string as an argument and returns the reversed version of the string.
        
6. Write a function `filterEvens` that takes an array of numbers as an argument and returns a new array containing only the even numbers.
